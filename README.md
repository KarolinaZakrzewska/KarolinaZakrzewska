## Hi I'm Karolina ðŸ‘‹




#####  ðŸŒ± In June 2022, I graduated from the ** Software Testing ** program at ** WSB University **.
I have always been interested in programming and in 2021 I decided to become a tester.

In 2022, I started working at Orange :orange_book: as a software tester. I will post my progress in test automation on my profile, I cordially invite you.

In my spare time, I run, do yoga and drink :coffee: - balance is important.
